# patient-
This project analyzes patient appointment data to predict attendance using machine learning. It includes thorough data cleaning, EDA, and modeling with KNN and Decision Trees. Results provide actionable insights to reduce no-shows and improve healthcare service efficiency.
 Project Overview

- **Dataset**: NHS appointment dataset with details like patient age, gender, diagnosis, GP practice, and appointment outcomes.
- **Objective**: Predict patient appointment attendance using demographic and clinical attributes.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib.

##  Key Steps

1. **Data Exploration**  
   - Visualize patient demographics and attendance rates.
   - Analyze distributions of age, gender, and outcome.
   - Check for missing values and duplicates.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handle invalid dates and missing values.
   - Remove duplicates.
   - Standardize categorical fields.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Standardize numerical features.
   - Apply variance thresholding.

4. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Train classification models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree Classifier.
   - Evaluate models using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
